# Browser languages

## What is this repository

Javascript Object with all possible Navigator Language in Browser's User-Agent, because I needed them for a project.

## JSON

JSON file can be found in the config directory.

## Why is the code in src dirty and outdated?

I made this repository a few years ago when I was still learning Javascript's basics. The code may be outdated but it is irrelevant since I only needed the JSON file.
